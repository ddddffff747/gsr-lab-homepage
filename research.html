                <p>
                    Seismic analysis of underground structures is a topic that we have been working from the beginning of my career
                    at Hanyang University. In a 5-year project on development of guidelines for seismic design of undersea tunnels
                    funded by Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA), I have performed research on several topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the topic was investigating the effect of the spatially varying ground motion on the longitudinal response
                    of the tunnel through a pseudo-static approach that we have newly developed. Another topic was quantifying the effect
                    of discontinuities on the structural response of subsea tunnels using discrete element analyses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of these studies and additional comprehensive suite of analyses were compiled and analyzed to develop
                    practical guidelines for seismic design of subsea tunnels. In 2015, we have been awarded a 3-year project from
                    the National Research Foundation of Korea on the topic of performance-based seismic design procedure for underground structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is our goal to propose a new performance-based framework for underground structures based on extensive nonlinear
                    pseudo-static and dynamic analyses. As part of the research, new damage states and indices will be presented.
                    The unique damage mechanism of various types of underground structures will be identified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We published a paper on the damage states and indices of cut and cover box tunnels in Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering.
                    In the study, the damage state was newly defined as the number of plastic hinges, whereas the damage index was defined
                    as the ratio of the elastic moment to yield moment. Currently, we are using inelastic dynamic analysis to replicate
                    the Daikai station failure. The validated numerical model will be used for comprehensive fragility analysis of underground structures.

                <p>
                    I have been involved in four projects on the seismic analysis and design of buried pipelines.
                    They were funded by KAIA, Korea Infrastructure Safety and Technology Corporation Institute, and K-Water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used three-dimensional (3D) time-domain analyses that uses nonlinear springs to simulate the pipeline-soil interaction.
                    The impact of spatially variable ground motion on the longitudinal strain of pipelines is investigated,
                    which is recognized as the critical seismic design parameter. The pipelines of interests include both buried gas and water pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is demonstrated that a design procedure that is widely used to estimate the damage does not provide a reliable prediction.
                    An improved design procedure that uses the free-field displacement time histories extracted from 1D site response analyses was proposed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current efforts include development of empirical predictive equation as functions of strain index, buried depth,
                    and pipeline properties. I have submitted a paper to Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering on this procedure.

                <p>
                    Seismic site response is an important topic of my research group. As the original developer of 1D site response
                    analysis program Deepsoil, which is one of the most widely used 1D nonlinear analysis program, I have been heavily
                    involved in this research topic for a long time. I have been funded two research projects by NRF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topics includes the development of a rate-dependent site response analysis method, use of a frequency dependent
                    equivalent linear method, and auto-selection process of the Rayleigh damping coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The compatibility issue of the deterministically derived site coefficients used with the probabilistically calculated
                    seismic hazard map was also a topic of interest. After two publications at Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering
                    as part of my doctoral study at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I continue to study this topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two journal papers on the fully probabilistic site coefficients of the deep deposits of the Mississippi Embayment
                    were published at Bulletin of Seismological Society of America and Journal of Korean Society of Civil Engineers, respectively.
                    I have applied this framework to Korea, where I newly perform seismic hazard analysis and derive probabilistic site coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked with Professor Jonathan Stewart and Dr. Dong-Youp Kwak formerly at University of California at Los Angeles
                    to incorporate the measured H/V ratio in the ground motion prediction equation (GMPE), where H/V ratio is defined as
                    the ratio of the horizontal to vertical spectral ratio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A large database of recorded motions from Kik-net and K-net in Japan were utilized to develop an additive function
                    to a nonlinear site amplification model already implemented in GMPEs. It has been successfully demonstrated that
                    the proposed function reduces the residual between the measured and predicted motions.

                <p>
                    I am actively involved in performing probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in Korea. A critical difficulty is defining
                    the seismicity of Korea, due to lack of recordings and because a community derived set of seismicity parameters are not yet presented.
                    Various approaches are undertaken to develop the seismicity data of Korea. I am currently working to develop Korea specific
                    uniform hazard response spectrum and to develop seismic hazard maps for 0.2s and 1.0s spectral acceleration.

                    Liquefaction assessment in low to moderate seismic regions is a new topic that I have currently a lot interest in.
                    The project was partly funded by NRF. My interest lies in the development of a simple yet robust pore pressure model
                    that uses only the liquefaction resistance curve to select its input parameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The motivation of this study is that in regions of low to moderate seismicity, use of a complex numerical simulation
                    tool based on plasticity soil models is prohibitive. I developed a model that is based on the concept of the damage
                    parameter and implemented it in Deepsoil. I also developed normalized liquefaction resistance curves based on
                    extensive database that was collected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A new simple shear test device with bender elements installed to measure shear wave velocity was set up at my
                    research group laboratory. The device was used to measure the liquefaction resistance curves of clean test sands
                    and soil samples extracted in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work was presented in two journal papers both published in Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering.
                    I am currently working with Professor Francesco Silvestri at University of Naples and Professor Youssef Hashash
                    at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign on this topic.
